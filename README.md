In this lesson we wrote a switch statement that determined what the grade mark was based of the score. A switch statement is the same as having a bunch of 'if' statements, just using a different format. This is done by running a statement that is based of the value that is returned after the given statement. In order to do this, we needed to assign each grade to a range of numbers. For example, for a A+ grade. The range was <=100 to >=85. This means that if the score was anywhere from 85 through to 100. In my code this is how I did this:

-case score <= 100 && score >= 85: { //Compares the values after to score
-let test_result = "A+"; //What we are saying, is that if it comes back that the previous statement is true, test_result is A+
-console.log(test_result); //logs variable test_result if the statement is correct
-break; 
     
What this is doing is seeing whether the statement is true or not. We are looking to see whether the score is greater than/equal to 85 or less than or equal to 100. If this statement is true, we then assign the variable test_result to A+, and console log the variable. If not, it looks at the next case to see whether it is true, and so on.
   
I had a bit of trouble with this as the format I was using didnt work properly with the goal we were trying to achieve. This was important as we were trying to do this task, and since I was using a different method, I was not getting a functioning code. It was good that I learned the mistake and learned from it, so that later on when I try to do a similar task, I will hopefully not make the same mistake. I was able to Identify the issue early on which meant that I didnt write out the full code, and have to go back through it and re-write it.
